The next morning, Markéta leaves her building, heard a honk beep and turns to find Glen standing across the street with a motocycle.

Markéta runs across the street, "What are doing here?"

Glen, "I just came out. You want to go for a spin?"

Markéta, "That's your bike?"

Glen, "It's me dad's. So do you fancy a spin, no?"

Markéta, "I'd love to, but I have to go to work."

Glen, "That's cool. Another time, yeah? Just thought while I had it, I'd drive over. And see if you were into going now." He gets on his bike, ready to leave.

Markéta sees how disappointed he is, hesitates, "Could you have me back by Lunch?"

Glen becomes smug again, "Yeah, totally." He hands another helmet to her and She gets on the backseat.

They ride Killiney Hill park by the ocean.

In the park, Glen's steps stop, astonished, "You have a boyfriend!"

Markéta walking ahead of him, turns back, smiling "Does it surprise you?"

Glen, "So where is he?"

Markéta, "He's back in Czech Republic. It's over now and, you know, I come here on my own."

Glen is confused, "Wait, so you don't have a boy friend."

Markéta, "Well, I don't know. He's coming to visit next week. It's complicated. I think I am more into him than he's into me."

They walk on. Glen glances at Markéta and stairs at the road, tring to decide whether Markéta is single or not. They arrive at a beautiful view of the ocean, standing several feet apart.

Glen exhales over the view, "What's the Czech for 'ocean'?"

Markéta turns to face Glen, "Oceán."

Glen repeats, "Ott-san."

Markéta, "Pretty much the same."

Glen asks again, "What's the Czech for... 'Do you love him?'"

Markéta smiles, "Miluješ ho?"

Glen practices a few times in his head and says it out loud, "So. Noor-esh-ho?"

Markéta looks at Glen, thinks for a second, feeling amused, "Miluju tebe."

Glen, "What?"

Markéta, "Come on, let's go."
