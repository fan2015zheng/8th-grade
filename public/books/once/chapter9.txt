[IF YOU WANT ME]
Are you really here
Or am I dreaming?
I can't tell dream from truth
For it's been so long
Since I have seen you
I can hardly remember your face anymore
When I get pretty lonely
And the distance causes only silence
I think of you smiling
With pride in your eyes
Lover that sighs
If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me
Satisfy me

Are you really sure that you believe me
When others say I lie?
I wonder if you could even despise me
When you know I really tried
To be a better one
To satisfy you
For you're everything to me
And I'll do what you ask me
If you let me be free
If you want me
Satisfy me
If you want me
Satisfy me
