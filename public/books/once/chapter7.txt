Glen tolds Markéta that he could take her hoover home and gives it back the next day. Markéta insists on following him and watch. They take a bus to the hoover repair shop his dad owns.

Inside the shop, Glen starts right away on her hoover. 

His dad is working on another hoover next to him, "Give us the sharp 8 there, son."

Glen takes the screwdriver out of the backpocket of his jeans and hands it over to his dad.

Glen's dad, "And the phillips." He reaches out his hand without looking and pretends to impatient with his son's slowness, "Come on," while giving Markéta a wink.

Markéta sits nearby, smiles, "Your son is a very talented man, sir."

Glen's dad, "Well, he should be. I trained him meself."

Markéta, "Oh, no. I meant the songs." Glen glances back appreciatively.

Glen's dad, "Oh, right. Is he?"

Markéta nods, "Very."

Glen puts down tools and turns to her, "Hi, that's done. You can take it back with you. It was just the belt, so it should be all right now."

Markéta, "Thank you. How much do I owe you?"

Glen waves his hand, "Oh, you're fine there. It' free."

Markéta insists, "Nothing's for free. How much?"

Dad looks at Markéta, impressed, "Say 4 euro, love."

Later Glen takes Markéta to his room above the repair shop and shows her some of his music recordings.

Markéta, "Wow. Can you transfer this stuff onto a disc for me so I can listen?"

Glen, "Yeah."

Markéta, "I have to go now."

Glen, "Do you want to stay the night?"

Markéta, "What?"

Glen, "Just kidding."
