Glen tolds Markéta that he could take her hoover home and gives it back the next day. Markéta insists on following him and watch. They take a bus to the hoover repair shop his father owns.

Inside the shop, Glen starts right away on her hoover. 

His father is working on another hoover nearby, "Give us the sharp 8 there, son."

Glen takes the screwdriver out of his backpocket of his jeans and hand it over to his dad.

Glen's dad, "And the phillips." He reaches out his hand without looking and pretends to impatient with his son's slowness, "Come on," while giving Markéta a wink.

Markéta sits on the side, smiles, "Your son is a very talented man, sir."

Glen's dad, "Well, he should be. I trained him meself."

Markéta, "Oh, no. I meant the songs." Glen glances back appreciatively.

Glen's dad, "Oh, right. Is he?"

Markéta nods, "Very."

Glen, "Hi, that's done. You can take it back with you. It was just the belt, so it should be all right now."

Markéta, "Thank you. How much do I owe you?"

Glen raises his hand, "Oh, you're fine there. It' free."

Markéta insists, "Nothing's for free. How much?"

Dad looks at Markéta, impressed, "Say 4 euro, love."

Later Glen takes Markéta to his room above the repair shop and shows her some of his music recordings.

Markéta, "Wow. Can you transfer this stuff onto disc for me so I can listen?"

Glen, "Yeah."

Markéta, "I have to go now."

Glen, "Do you want to stay the night?"

Markéta, "What?"

Glen, "Just kidding."
