[WHEN YOUR MIND'S MADE UP]
So
If you want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running to fight
And I'll be at your door
When there's nothing worth running for
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change it
When your minds made up
When your minds made up
There's no point trying to stop it

You see
You're just like everyone
When the shit falls
All you want to do is run away
And hide all by yourself
When you're far from me
There's nothing else
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to change it
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point even talking
When your mind's made up
When your mind's made up
There's no point trying to fight it
When your minds
Your minds
Ah
There's no point trying to change it
When your
Ah
So...
If you ever want something
And you call, call
Then I'll come running
