[Say It to Me Now]
Scratching at the surface now
And I'm trying hard to work it out
And so much has gone misunderstood
And this mystery only leads to doubt
And I didn't understand
When you reached out to take my hand
And if you have something to say
You'd better say it now

'Cause this is what you've waited for
Your chance to even up the score
And as these shadows fall
On me now I'll win somehow
Yeah
'Cause I'm picking up a message, Lord
That I'm closer than I've been before
So if you have something to say
Say it to me now
Just say it to me now, now
Oh, oh, oh.
