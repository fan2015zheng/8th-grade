[FALLING SLOWLY]
I don't know you, but I want you
All the more for that
And words fall through me and always fool me
And I can't react

And games that never amount to more than they're meant
Will play themselves out

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice
You had the choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, eyes that know me
And I can't go back
Moods that take me and erase me
And I'm painted black

Well, you have suffered enough and warred with yourself
It's time that you won

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice
You had the choice
You've made it now

Take this sinking boat and point it home
We've still got time
Raise your hopeful voice
You had the choice
You've made it now

Falling slowly, sing your melody
I'll sing along

Call and I'll sing along
