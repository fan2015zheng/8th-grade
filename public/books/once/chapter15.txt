In the evening, at the dinner table, Glen plays a song from his recording to his dad. His dad listens while seems deep in thoughts.

When the music ends, Glen asks, "Well, what do you think?"

His dad shakes his head without a word.

Glen, "You like it? It's just a demo you know?"

His dad looks over to Glen, "It's fucking brilliant."

Glen smiles with relief, "Really?"

His dad, "Fantastic stuff. That'll be a hit, no question. When are you off?"

Glen, "What?"

His dad, "Well, I've a few hundred quid for you for a deposit on a place. Going to come over and see you when you're settled in."

Glen looks at his dad, feeling guilty.

His dad, "When do you think you'll be able to go?"

Glen, "I'm going the day after tomorrow dad."

His dad, surprised, "Good man." He smiles, "About time."

Glen, "Will you be all right?"

His dad, "What do you mean? I was all right for years before you came along, wasn't I?"

Glen, "I don't have to go now. I can put this thing off for a few months."

His dad, "Go. Best of luck, son." He resumes his cigarette, "Now play it again."

Glen is going to London to try to get a record deal.
