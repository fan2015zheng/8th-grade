After successfully writing the book《8th Grade》, I want to write another movie-based book.《Once》is one of my favourite movies. I find it not as moving as I watched it ten years ago, but it's still safe to say it's in my top 10.

This book《Once》gets all its scenes and converations from the movie. But I changed the circumstances of the guy and the girl because I want to change the ending.

The movie《Once》is a musical in the sense that it has more than 10 songs played in full length in the movie. I added mp3 of 6 songs in this book. So yeah. Enjoy!
