Loud music plays in the studio. Beer bottles, juice bottles, and paper cups are everywhere in the control room. People are sleeping on chairs, couches.

Later Glen asks, "What day is it?"

Everyone laughs except the drummer. He is still napping on the couch.

Eamon, "Monday. I think it's time we did the, uh, the car test."

Mark√©ta, "What's the car test, Eamon?"

Eamon, "We've been listening back on these, uh, big studio speakers. So it's time we had a go on some shitty speakers. Let's go for a spin and have a listen in me car."

Glen, "Great, man."

Eamon, "We'll clear this up later."

They drive to the beach, have some fun there and comes back to the studio. Eamon burns Glen 10 CDs. The band disolves right there.
