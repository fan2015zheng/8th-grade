[LIES]
I think it's time we give it up
And figures out what's stopping us
From breathing easy
and talking straight
The way is clear if you're ready now
The volunteer is slowing down
And taking time
To save himself

The little cracks that escate
Before we knew it was too late
From making circles
And telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I, I can't keep up with you
Maybe if you slowed down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn

The little cracks that escate
Before we knew it was too late
From making circles
And telling lies
You're moving too fast for me
And I, I can't keep up with you
Maybe if you slowed down for me
I could see you're only telling
Lies, lies, lies
Breaking us down with your
Lies, lies, lies
When will you learn

So plant the thought
And watch it grow
Wind it up
And let it go
