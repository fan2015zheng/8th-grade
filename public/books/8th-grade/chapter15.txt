Wednesday evening, Kayla lies in bed. Her phone lights up. There is an Instagram message, "Hey kayla!!!"

Kayla replies, "Hey!"

Gabe, "Thanks for following me back!"

Kayla, "no prob!"

Gabe, "it's gab from kennedy's pool party"

Gabe, "GABE, I mean."

Kayla puts down the phone. She goes through her time capsule shoebox and finds a Spongebob model USB flash drive. She plugs it in her laptop and puts on her headphone.

Hey, Kayla! It's you. Kayla.
I'm just making this video
to congratulate you on finishing eighth grade.
Whoo-hoo!
I am so, so, so, so proud of you!
Okay, so I'm making this video on a Friday.
Um, and, yeah, Fridays are really fun.
And I'm about to have my first middle school weekend.
Um... And I bet it's not really exciting to you, or whatever,
Because you've already had a bunch of middle school weekends,
but it's really exciting to me.
Yeah, I have, like, so many questions for you also.
Like, do you have a boyfriend?
And is he nice?
Uh, what's the coolest thing you've done,
or the second coolest thing you've done?
Uh, yeah, so you don't have to answer
because I can't hear you anyways.
But, yeah, thanks for listening. 
Bye.

Downstairs Mark sits on the couch staring at a tablet through reading glasses. He looks over to Kayla as she comes down the stairs.

"Can you help me burn something in the backyard?" She sounds defeated and exhausted.

Mark wonders what is happening, "Yes."
