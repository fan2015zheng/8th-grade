Hey, Kayla. Um... It's you, from 8th grade.
Congrats on finishing high school.
I'm so proud of you.
And it's crazy to think that, like, you're almost 18.
Um... And I bet you probably look a lot different than me,
which is cool. 
Or, if you don't, and you look, 
you know, mostly the same, that's cool too.
How did you do on the SATs? I mean, hopefully good.
But if not, you know, school sucks.
Especially math. Um...
Uh, what else?
Um, do you have a boyfriend?
It's cool if you don't, but if you do,
he should be treating you well because you deserve it.
Is dad still a dork?
Because, if he's not, he's probably just someone pretending to be dad.
And I really hope that
you're not too sad about, like,
leaving all your friends for college,
but you can still stay in contact with them.
And if you don't, that's fine.
Because you'll make new friends at college anyways,
so it's, like, whatever.
And I know, like, you probably don't want any advice
from some dumb 8th-grader or whatever,
but if high school sucked for you,
I'm really sorry about that.
And that, you know, that sucks.
But I mean, it's whatever.
Middle school wasn't so great for me, but I'm past it now.
And I'm moving forward,
and you can do that too with high school,
if it didn't go great.
Just because things are happening to you right now 
doesn't mean that they're always gonna happen to you.
And things will change. And...
You know, you never know what's gonna, like, happen next,
and that's what makes things exciting and scary.
And fun.
Yeah, okay. So stay cool,
and I can't wait to be you.
Love, Kayla.
Gucci!
