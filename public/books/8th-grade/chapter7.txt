Hey, guys. It's Kayla, back here with another video.
Okay, so the topic of today's video, which is super cool,
is, How To Be Confident.
So, um, I think one thing a lot of people think about confidence
is that, like, you know, you're born with it.
You either are confident or you're not.
You know, just like how some people are tall.
You're either tall or short.
But it's not like that, actually.
Confidence is a choice.
Like, the really awesome thing about confidence is that
you can just start acting like it,
even if you feel like you don't have any.
For example, I used to, like, not to be confident at all.
But then one day, I'm like, Hmm, I want to be confident.
So, then I just kind of started acting like it,
and then it made me feel good,
and then I actually started being confident.
Like, without trying.
And, like, a big part of being confident is being brave,
and you can't be brave unless you're scared.
So, for those of you who are 
feeling scared about being confident,
that's actually a big part of confidence, to be scared.
That's normal.
Because you can't be brave without being scared.
So, go out there and just be, like, confident. 
And if you don't feel confident,
just do it anyways.
Make yourself confident.
