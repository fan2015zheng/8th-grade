The mall announces closing and the teens have to leave. Trevor and Riley both have cars. Olivia and Kayla go with Riley. 

Olivia in the passenger seat turns back to Kayla, "You have fun tonight, Kayla?"

Kayla smiles, "Yeah. Totally."

Olivia, "Good." She turns to Riley, "She's just, like, so fun and easy to be around, isn't she?"

Riley, "Totally."

Kayla relaxed, "You know I was just sitting there watching you guys eat and all I was thinking was, like, you guys are just so cool.

Olivia, "I think you are cool."

Riley pulls over by Olivia's house. But Olivia wonders if they should drop off Kayla first. Kayla assures Olivia that she's fine. Olivia looks at Kayla as she gets out, "Let's do it again soon. Um... You're awesome. You rule, You're great."

Kayla smiles shily and waves at Olivia, "Bye. Uh, good night."

Olivia also says goodbye to Riley. Riley starts the car and drives down a dark road with Kayla still in the back.

Riley, "Olivia's cool, yeah?"

Kayla, "Yeah, totally. She's like, the best."

Riley, "Yeah, we're, like, best friends."

Kayla chuckles, "Really?"

Riley, "Yeah."

Kayla, "That's awesome." She chuckles.

Riley looks in the rear-view mirror, "Kind of awkward talking when you're in the back seat."

Kayla chuckles, "Yeah..."

Riley pulls over.

Kayla sits up, "Uh... Should I get in the front?"

Riley, "No, no, no. It's all good." He vacates the front seat.

Riley lightly taps on the hood as he makes his way around the car. He slides into the back seats with Kayla. The dome light goes off. She smiles uneasily.

Riley looks at Kayla, "So... You excited about next year?"

Kayla, "Yeah, totally."

Riley, "Yeah, totally. You should be. You're like the coolest freshman I've ever met, and you're not even a freshman yet."

Kayla chuckles, "Thanks."

Riley, "It's crazy. Yeah. I mean, you should watch out for guys, definitely. They're gonna try pick you up, you know?"

Kayla, "Really?"

Riley, "Yeah. I mean, definitely."

Kayla says sacastically, "Yeah, right." She looks at Riley and chuckles.

Riley, "No. I'm serious." Elbow on the car window, a hand rest on the passenger seat back, he taps his thumb a few times. "Truth or Dare?"

Kayla, "Uh... What?"

Riley, "Truth or Dare? You ever play Truth or Dare?"

Kayla, "Oh. Yeah. Sorry."

Riley, "Yeah. Yeah. Truth or Dare?"

Kayla hesitates, "Truth."

Riley, "Okay, uh..." He prolongs his "uh" and chuckles, "How far have you gone?"

Kayla feels weird, "How far have I gone?"

Riley, "Yeah. Yeah, like, uh... First base, or..."

Kayla, "Oh, okay, yeah." she exhales. Looking down, she says "I don't know. Do you mean, like, you know, all time or, uh, like, more recent, or..."

Riley sounds casual, "Let's go all time."

Kayla, "Well, okay then..." She speaks slowly trying to give herself time to think. Looking down, she chuckles nervously, "Uh... I don't know. I'd say, like... You know, 3rd base." She peeks at Riley, who looks shocked. "Sorry, just kidding. I meant 2nd, you know. I get second and third, like, mixed up a lot, you know."

Riley looks at the right side of Kayla's face, "You're funny. I mean, it's okay if you haven't done anything."

Kayla, "Yeah." She self-conciously tucks her hair behind her ear.

Riley laughs, "You wanna ask me?"

Kayla, "Uh... Okay. Yeah. Uh... How far have you..." She is embarrassed.

Riley, "Oh, no. No. Truth or Dare."

Kayla chuckles, feeling more embarrassed, "Right. Duh. Uh... Okay, well, uh... Truth or Dare?"

Riley, "I'll take dare."

Kayla, "Okee. Uh..." She clumsily picks up a quarter from the car door panel, "Uh... Put this quarter in your mouth."

Riley, "Ew!"

Kayla laughs nervously, "Yeah. Sorry, that was gross. Uh... Okay, well, you know. What do you wanna do? you know, You can pick."

Riley briefly glances out of the window with a smile. "I don't know. Shit, um..." He clicks his tongue and chuckles, "I could take my shirt off? I mean that's stupid though. Is that stupid?"

Kayla doesn't want to offend Riley, "Uh... No. That's fine."

Riley, "Fuck. I feel like a fucking idiot. Is it fine if I take my shirt off? Yeah? Okay. I don't know. All right. Gonna do it." He pulls his t-shirt over his head.

Kayla takes a peek at him and averted her eyes.

Riley chuckles, "Truth or Dare?"

Kayla, "Uh... Uh... Truth."

Riley, "You're no fun."

Kayla breathes heavily, "Uh... Sorry. Uh, okay, well. Dare." She stares ashamedly at her lap.

Riley, "Takes your shirt off."

Kayla, "Uh... I'm not, like super comfortable with that."

Riley, "Well, do you think I'm comfortable right now?"

Kayla chuckles and finds it hard to breathe, "I don't know."

Riley, "Calm down, relax. Take a deep breath. Come on." He touches her shoulder, "Take your shirt off."

Kayla snarls, "NO!" Immediately she chuckles, "Sorry." Avoiding Riley's gaze, her shoulders heave tensely.

The car is filled with silence. Riley puts his shirt back on.

Later Kayla looks down in the moving car, "I'm really sorry."

Riley, "It's fine."

Kayla, "I'm sorry."

Riley is annoyed, "Stop saying you're sorry. I said it was fine, dude. Okay? So, stop saying that, okay? You know, and now you're gonnna have your first hookup with some asshole at a party, and you're not gonna be good at it, and he's gonna tell all his friends about it, and you're gonna get made fun of and feel like shit. Do you want that?"

Kayla mumbles, "No."

Riley, "This was about you. Okay? I'm... I'm trying... I was trying to help you, okay?"

Kayla, "I know. I really appreciate it. I just..." She stammers, "I... I... I'm sorry. I mean... It was just... It was a lot at once, you know. I don't know, I just... I didn't want to do that right now."

Riley is silent.

Kayla, "Please don't tell Olivia about this."

By Kayla's house, Riley's car slows to a stop, street light glowing in the dark neighbourhood. Kayla climbs out of the back. The teen maitains her composure as she briskily strides along a dark sidewalk. A motion sensor light comes on as she turns into a drive way and heads up the stairs to her house. She cannot hold her tears any longer. She bursts through the door into the kitchen and storms through the house. Mark, stilling feeling sorry about what happened in the mall, welcomes Kayla, "Hey, How'd it... Honey?" She runs upstairs to her room and slams the door. Mark follows her, opens the door and finds her lamp lying on the carpet along with her time capsule and its content. Kayla sits on the floor crying against her bed. Mark kneels beside her and tries to console her. She pushes his hand away. Mark stays by her side.
