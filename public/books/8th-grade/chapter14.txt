Key, guys. It's Kayla, back with another video. Um...
So... I'm making this video to just
kind of say that I'm not gonna be making videos anymore.
Or, you know, I'm taking a break or something. Um...
And I don't... I don't know if anyone is, like, really watching or cares, um...
But if you are, sorry if this is like, a bummber to you.
Um... But... It's the right thing to do, um...
I started making videos, you know, to, like,
give tips and stuff.
And, you know, help you guys out, but
I don't know.
If I'm being really honest, I'm probably not, like
the best person to give advice because I like, you know,
I like giving advice
and, like, and talking about doing stuff,
but I can't really actually do that stuff.
Um... And... Yeah.
And. I don't know.
It's just, like...
Um... I'm really, like, nervous all the time, and...
I, like, I could be be doing nothing, and I'm just
nervous. It's like, um...
It's like I could...
I'm waiting in line for, like, a roller coaster, and
that stupid, like, 
butterflies-in-your-stomach feeling you get, like...
I get that all the time,
and then I never get the feeling
of after you ride the roller coaster, 
and I... I try really hard not to feel that way, um...
But... I don't know. I just can't... Um...
So, I think if you guys are going through, like, tough times and stuff, um, 
you deserve someone who can go through tough times 
and make themselves feel better with their advice,
and actually do the stuff they talk about.
You know, just
If they can make themselves feel better,
then maybe they can help you feel better.
So, yeah, I think those are the reasons
why I'm gonna stop making videos, um...
And, yeah.
I hope you guys all have, like, you know, good lives,
and maybe I'll see you guys around.
Bye.
Gucci.
