Hey, guys. Kayla back here with another video.
Uh, okay, so the topic of today's video is
Putting Yourself Out There.
Um, okay. So, like, what does that mean?
Where is "there"?
Well, "there" can be anywhere
that you wouldn't usually go.
You know, maybe because it's, like,
weird or scary or, um, something like that.
Um, okay, and now you're probably thinking, like, you know, well,
Why would I want to go somewhere like that?
And there's actually lots of reasons.
Uh, one reason is that people might not know, like,
the real you. 
Like, if you only ever see, you know, 
some people at school or something
then those people are only gonna know the school you.
But if you put yourself out there
and you go to places you wouldn't usually go,
people can know the movie you or the pool you
or the party you or the weekend you.
All the yous that make up the real you.
Like, for example,
this one time I was having a bunch of friends over,
and my dad made me invite this one weird girl, or whatever,
and, you know, I didn't really want to invite her
'cause at school she was just always weird,
so I didn't like her.
But my dad made me invite her,
so then she came over,
and I got to know the real her.
And she actually was really cool and funny.
And, like, just awesome.
And all my friends were just, like, "Who is she?"
And everyone was just, like,
talking about her the whole time.
So, yeah. And
I guess that's basically what I was trying to say,
like, you know, you just need
to put yourself out there
and, like, face your fears
and, you know, let people know the real you.
And, like, it doesn't matter if you're scared
because everyone's gonna be scared.
Uh... Okay, uh, hope..Bleh.
