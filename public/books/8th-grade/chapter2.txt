It's the fourth period at Miles Grove Middle School on a Friday. Mr McDaniel announces to his auditorium audience, "8th graders, next week is your last week in Miles Grove Middle School..." Some boy in the audience shouts out "LeBron James". Students laugh and turn to look. Kayla lowers her head and chuckles. She then sits up and tries to pay attention to Mr. McDaniel. "...And we also have your 6th-grade time capsules. Remember when you made those shoeboxes the first week of sixth grade? Remember how we said that it would be a gift to the future you when you finally made it here at Miles Grove Middle School? Well, you have made it. So, pick those up in the lobby after this assembly's over..."

"...Now I'm going to hand things over to Mrs. Rosh, who will read out the results of the 8th-grade superlatives. Mrs. Rosh?" Mr. McDaniel claps as Mrs Rosh steps up to the podium. No student claps. Kayla tries to supress a yawn.

Mrs Rosh adjusts the mic, "Good afternoon," the mic gives a high pitched screech. She continues, "Class superlatives, as voted by you, the students." She pauses briefly, "Most athletic, Wyatt Conville and Dawn Ringelheim." There are some sparse claps. "Class Clowns, Jed Goodwin and Missy Vitale." Some kid blows a raspberry. Laughters follow. Mrs. Rosh reads on, "Most Talkative, Pat Druschel and Jackie Stasiak. Most Quiet..." Kayla looks up. She watches Mrs Rosh, holding her breath, her drowsiness gone. "Andrew Fields and Kayla Day." Kayla shuts her eyes and tightens her lips.
