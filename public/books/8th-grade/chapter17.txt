On Saturday, Gabe invites Kayla on Instagram to hang out at his House on a short notice. Kayla tells her dad about Gabe and asks him for advice. Mark encourages Kayla to go and drops her off at Gabe's house.

Gabe shows Kayla the homey dinning room.

Kayla, "Wow."

Gabe, "Thank you. Do you want to take a seat?"

Kayla, "Oh, sure" 

She sits down and he helps push in her chair.

Gabe, "You, uh, you like chicken nuggets, right?"

Kayla says politely, "Yeah."

Gabe, "Okay, Cool. Got a 20-piece, and I also got two of every kind of sauce. But, you know, if you have a favorite sauce, and you want more than one packet of it, you can have mine. I like all the sauces equally."

Kayla, "Thanks"

Gabe, "Yeah. Oh, and the nuggets have been sitting out for a little bit, because, you know, I didn't know when you'd be here, so just, uh, tell me if they're too cold, and I can heat them up in the micromave, okay?"

Kayla, "Okay"

Gabe picks up a piece of paper leaning against Kayla's plate, "Whoops, sorry, must have left this out by accident. Sorry. I'm so stupid."

Kayla, "Uh, no problem."

Gabe, "You want to see it? No, wait, No, it's stupid."

Kayla, "Sure."

Gabe hands over the paper, "Okay. Yeah."

Kayla examines the paper, "What is it?"

Gabe, "Oh, well, I go to archery camp every summer. And last summer, I got five bull's-eyes in a day, so, you know, they gave me the Sharpshooter of the Week Award."

Kayla, "That's actually really cool."

Gabe, "Yeah, not really. It's... It's stupid."

Kayla, "I think it's really cool, but...Yeah."

Gabe, "Well, I think it's stupid." He turns around and walks to his chair, smiling to himself.

Gabe sits at the opposite end of the long table, raises a cup of water, "To our, uh, first friend hangout, I guess."

Kayla raises her cup too, "Yeah."

They toast with their cups and Gabe takes a sip, accidentally spilling on himself. Each have a plate of chicken nuggets and fries in front of them with different kind of sauces neatly arranged in a rainbow colored pattern.

Gabe, "Do you believe in God?" He takes a bite of a nugget.

Kayla chews a fry and covers her mouth, "Yes."

Gabe, "Okay, cool. Um... You like the silverware?"

Kayla, "Yeah, It's really cool."

Gabe, "Yeah. It's, uh, a lightsaber. Check it out."

Kayla swipes her spoon across the plate, imitating lightsaber whooshing and chuckles.

Gabe, "I've, uh... I've seen some of your videos.

Kayla, "Oh, those are really dumb."

Gabe, "No, no, no, no. They're actually really cool. I love those videos. Um... You're really... You're really smart about stuff. Like, you know a lot of things."

Kayla, "Thanks."

Gabe, "I was thinking you should, maybe you can... Maybe have, like, your own talk show or something."

Kayla chuckles, "Yeah."

Gabe, "Am I being weird at all to you? Like, uh..."

Kayla, "No, no, no..." She really enjoys him.

Gabe, "Okay. Good. I'm just nervous."

Kayla, "You're fine. No, no, no. It's fine. Um... I am too. Yeah."

Gabe, "Yeah."

Kayla, "Um... Am I being, like, quiet? Or too, like..."

Gabe, "No way."

Kayla, "Okay, am I, like, talking enough?"

Gabe, "You've been pretty talkative, but not in an annoying way. Just, uh... Just responding to me, you know."

Kayla, "Thanks. Yeah."

Gabe, "This is a good conversation, don't you think?"

Kayla, "Yeah, We're doing some good talking."

Gabe, "Yeah. It's a nice chat. You know what would go great with this?"

Kayla, "Hmm?"

Gabe, "Some Szechuan sauce!"

Kayla points at Gabe with surprise, "You like Rick and Morty, too?"

Gabe, "Yes. Yes. Yes."

Kayla waves her fists, "Nice."

Gabe imitates Rick, "Yes. Yes, Morty. The Szechuan sauce! We gotta... We gotta get it, Morty. Come on, Morty, come on."  

Kayla imitates Morty, "Oh, jeez, Rick."

Gabe imitates Rick, "Shut up. Morty, Yes!"

Kayla imitates Morty, "Rick, I don't know!" 

Gabe, "That show's amazing."

Kayla nods, smiling, "Yeah"

Gabe chews the chicken nuggets, "Hmm. You're awesome."

Kayla nods, "Thanks."

Gabe, "No problem."

Later Kayla climbs to the passenger seat of her dad's car.

Mark, "Hey."

Kayla, "Hey."

Mark, "You have fun?"

Kayla, "Yeah. Yeah,  it was a lot of fun."

Mark, "Good."

She buckles her seat belt and Mark pulls away from Gabe's house. He catches Kayla smiling to herself and he smiles too.
