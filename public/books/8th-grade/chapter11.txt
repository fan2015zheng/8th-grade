Moments later, Kayla ventures into the kitchen wearing a new outfit. Mark is washing dishes, his back to Kayla, not hearing her walking up.

Kayla stands behind Mark for a few seconds and says quietly, "Dad?"

Mark glances back at her, "Yeah? What's up?"

Kayla is hesitating.

Mark shuts off the water and looks concerned, "Is there something wrong?"

Kayla asks sheepishly, "Can I go out with friends tonight?"

Mark is caught off guard but he says yes.

On the way to the mall, Kayla plays a game on her phone in the passenger seat when she receives a text from Olivia that reads "We just got here xo :);)"

Kayla glances her dad behind the wheel, "Can you not look like that, please?"

Mark, "What?" he scoffs, "Like what?"

Kayla, "Just, like, the way you're looking."

Mark is confused, "Looking at the road?"

Kayla, "You can look at the road, Dad. I obviously didn't mean that. Just, like, don't be weird and quiet while you do it."

Mark sighs, "Sorry. Hey, how was the shadow thing..."

Kayla interrupts, "No, you were being quiet, which is fine. Just, like, don't be weird and quiet. Because, like, I look over at you, and I think you're about to drive us into a tree or something, and then I get really freaked out, and then I can't text my friends. So just, like, be quiet and drive. And don't look weird and sad. Please."

Mark carefully says okay and goes back to being quiet.

Kayla looks over her dad and shuts her eyes exasperately, "That's worse."

Kayla texts back, "Cool! I'm already there!" plus two Love emojis.
