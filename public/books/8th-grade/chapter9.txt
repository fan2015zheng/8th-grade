Hey, guys. It's Kayla, back with another video.
So today, I want to talk to you about growing up.
Okay, so growing up can be a little bit scary and weird, 
but it's also a really good thing,
because you get to change things
that you might not like about yourself,
and that's good because change is a good thing.
Okay, I'm an 8th grader,
which means next year I will be in high school.
Now, high school is a lot different than middle school
because middle school is like, really, uh... 
Well... Middle school is, like, in the middle.
In middle school, everyone is a lot younger than high schoolers and when you're young
you haven't changed as much as when you're older.
So, yeah, high schoolers have changed
more than middle schoolers,
and since change is a good thing,
that means that high schoolers are really good.
Uh... Okay, uh, next thing about growing up...
Yeah, okay. Uh... 
So the thing about growing up is that it's going to happen,
so don't fight it.
Some parts of growing up will be really hard and not good,
but I promise that growing up 
will eventually get really good.
I mean, I used to be afraid of growing up,
and then I realized it's going to make everything better,
and now I can't wait to grow up. 
Uh, yeah. Cool.
Uh, okay. Uh...
