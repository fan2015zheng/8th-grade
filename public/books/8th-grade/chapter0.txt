I watched《8th Grade》on Amazon Prime Video and find it exceptionally good. Bo Burnham had written the scripts and directed the movie. I wanted to write a book based on this movie. Writing is a new frontier for learning English after being proficient.

This book《8th Grade》is a result of such aspiration. Unexpected but undiscouraging, as it happens, 95% of the content in this book is copied directly from dialogues in the movie and its audio description. As much as I would like to think that I am the the author, I'm not. I am an editor at best, a bootlegger at worst. 

This book is published at https://8th-grade.netlify.app. After visiting the website, as you already know, click the left or right margin to turn pages. Click the middle of a page to toggle the menu.《8th Grade》is about 10,000 words, maybe around 30 pages in a paper book. It's a movie-long read. Enjoy!
