I watched《8th Grade》on Amazon Prime Video and find it exceptionally good. Bo Burnham had written the scripts and directed the movie. I wanted to write a book based on this movie. Writing is a new frontier for learning English after being proficient.

This book《8th Grade》is a result of such aspiration. Unexpected but undiscouraging, as it happens, 95% of the content in this book is copied directly from dialogues in the movie and its audio description. As much as I would like to think that I am the the author, I'm not. I am an editor slash bootlegger. 

Click left or right margin to turn pages. Click the middle of a page to toggle the menu. Remember what chapter you are on and refresh if the webpage malfunctions. The book《8th Grade》, about 10,000 words, is pretty much the movie 《8th Grade》minus Elsie Fisher's talented performance. It probably takes the same minutes to read this book as to watch the movie. So yeah. Enjoy!
