After watching the movie 8th Grade on Amazon Prime Video, I tried to find its book to read. The movie is not based on any best-selling books. Bo Burnham had written the scripts and directed the movie. 

I played with the idea of writing novels before. It should be a good way to learn English. This books is a result of me trying to write a book based on the movie 8th Grade. Not how I visioned it at the beginning, but at the end, 95% of the content is copied directly from dialogues in the movie and its audio description. So I am an editor.

The movie does not give any indication how Gabe asks out Kayla. In the book I feel that I have to fill in this morsel of information. The rest details are all identical to the movie, even though I dropped a few scenes.

《8th Grade》is about 10,000 words, maybe around 30 pages in a paper book, maybe an hour read.
